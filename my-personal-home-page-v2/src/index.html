      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="text">
        I have completed my formal schooling in 2006 and went on to do a certificate in accounting and have gained the majority of my accounting knowledge by experience in the workplace.
        Currently I am employed full time as an assistant accountant and have been working in accounts for as long as I can remember.

        Recently I have been getting an interest in Software development and found myself very intrigued by the tech world that led to me subsequently spending my evenings learning to code on free code platforms.

        In addition to that I really do enjoy spending time with my family in the outdoors, baking, exploring new places and making Youtube videos on our experiences.

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p class="text">
        I would like to start my Software Development Bootcamp in 2022 through Code Your Future, in order to gain a qualification in the industry and to officially start my tech career.
        What I love the most about software development is the contant learning and endless possibilities it provides. It may be challenging, but I will always end up learning invaluable skills.
        I'm really excited for all collaborations that will happen in the future.
